# Hospital Database Management System Web Application
This repository contains a Hospital Database Management System web application developed using HTML, CSS, Django, Python, and SQLite. The system aims to efficiently manage patient records, treatment details, and provide secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms. The application incorporates an intuitive user interface and robust APIs for seamless communication between the front-end and back-end components.

## Features
The Hospital Database Management System offers the following features:

- **Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram**: The system is designed based on an ER diagram that includes entities such as receptionist, data entry operator, doctor, patient, and admin. This diagram serves as a blueprint for the system's structure and relationships between different entities.

- **Seamless Communication**: Robust APIs have been implemented to ensure smooth communication between the front-end and back-end components of the web application. This enables efficient data transfer and interaction between users and the system.

- **Storage, Retrieval, and Management of records**: The application provides efficient storage, retrieval, and management of patient records and treatment details. Users can easily search for and access relevant information, facilitating streamlined operations within the hospital.

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms have been implemented using Django's built-in features. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information and perform specific actions within the system.
